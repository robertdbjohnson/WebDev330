        I was able to read the syllabus and learn more abouthow the class works.

        Example of local storage

        function clickCounter() {
            if(typeof(Storage) !== "undefined") {
              if (localStorage.clickcount) {
                localStorage.clickcount = Number(localStorage.clickcount)+1;
              } else {
                localStorage.clickcount = 1;
              }
              document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = "You have clicked the button " + localStorage.clickcount + " time(s).";
            } else {
              document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = "Sorry, your browser does not support web storage...";
            }
        }

        I found this video to be very helpful in learning about storage
